# Problem 4: Operators
#
# PART 1
# Notice the difference between float and integer math.

# 1. Print the result of 5 divided by 2
print 5/2
# 2. Print the result of 5 divided by 2.0
print 5/2.0
# 3. Print the result of 5.0 divided by 2
print 5.0/2
# 4. Print the result of 7 times the quantity of 1 over 2
print 7*(1/2)
# 5. Print the result of 7 times the quantity of 1 over 2.0
print 7*(1/2.0)
# 6. Print the result of 5 raised to the power of 2
print 5^2
# 7. Print the result of 5.0 raised to the power of 2
print 5.0/2
# 8. Print the result of 5 raised to the power of 2.0
print 5/2.0

# PART 2
# Transcribe the equations from part2.pdf preserving the order of operations with parenthesis as needed. Save
# each as a variable and print the variable.

# 9. Equation 1
a= 3 * 5/ (2+3)
print a
# 10. Equation 2
import math
b= math.sqrt(7 + 9) * 2
print b
# 11. Equation 3
c= (4 - 7)**3
print c
# 12. Equation 4
d= (-19 + 100)**(1.0/4)
print d
# 13. Equation 5
e= 6 % 4
print e

# PART 3
# Write two equations with the same operands and operators but that evaluate to different values. Store each in a
# separate variable, then print the variables.
a= "3 * 3"
print a
b= "2 * 3"
print b
