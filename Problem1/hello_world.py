# Problem 1: Hello World
#
# Your first assignment is just like the program from Introduction to Python we did in class. We will recreate it
# here for practice on assignments.
#
# Recall that a program is just a set of instructions for the computer to execute. Let's start with a basic command:
#   print x: Prints the value of the expression x, followed by a new line.
#
# Expected output:
#
print "Hello, world!"
#
#print 'Hello, world!' to the console.
